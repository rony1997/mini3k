    <p class="lead font-italic">Currently I am NJIT student. I am doing Graduate Certificate course major in Business and Information Systems. Here I have created FAQ project under
    guidelines of my Professor Keith Williams, so in this project one can register/ login into this website and create multiple questions and also multiple answers can be given
    by multiple users as well. Also with that user can also create their own profile and also edit it.</p>
